### Hi there 👋

My name is Thales, I graduated from the [Federal University of Rio Grande - FURG](https://furg.br/) in Computer Engineering. I started programming very early, my first "Hello World" was when I was 10 years old, using Javascript, since then I've been studying computing and discovering the countless problems that can be solved with computing. I love solving problems, I've participated in the programming marathon, Hackathons and I'm always looking for new challenges!
